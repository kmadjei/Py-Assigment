# Python Assignment 1

This is the first Python assignment for the Full Stack program at the Canadian Business College(CBC).

The assignment is a commandline based program that calculates the grades of the user inputs.

## Features

The program prompts the user to record information about the courses he or she has completed. The program
will then proceed to calculating the overall grade after validating the data provided.

## Testing

During the coding phase, each functionality was tested for the required feedback before progressing further into the project.

**User's Perspective**
    > As a user, when I run the program I should receive feedback that shows the program is working
    > When I enter incorrect data, the program should give me another chance to correct myself
